        <h2>History of Jorasanko Thakur Bari</h2>
        <p>The history of Jorasanko Thakur Bari goes back to 1784 when a piece of land was gifted to Nilmoni Tagore on
            the east side of Chitpur Road after he left his family home due to irreconcilable disputes within the
            family. Nilmoni Tagore built a small house at Jorasanko. <br>

            The Thakur Bari was later expanded by Prince Dwarkanath Tagore, the illustrious grandfather of Rabindranath
            Tagore in 18th century. Situated in the north of Kolkata, the mansion is located in Jorasanko, near Girish
            Park on Chittaranjan Avenue. The land was donated to Prince Dwarkanath Tagore by the famous Seth family.
            Rabindranath was born here in 1861 and spent a major part of his life in this home. It is here that the
            Nobel laureate passed away in 1941. <br>
            The name Jorasanko came from the fact that there are twin Shiva temples near the home.

            The Jorasanko Thakur Bari is spread over 35000 square meters. The palatial brick red mansion was first
            started from a small house where different wings and alleys were added slowly to the original architecture.

            The rounded verandah adds to the advantage that members could clearly watch programs of the natya manch that
            was at the centre of the house. Even at a time when the purdah system was at its prime, the Tagores never
            followed it at their home. The women of the family were equally entitled for open discussions regarding
            culture, literature, art, business and sundry. This very outlook of the family, later contributed to greater
            cultural changes in the society.
