        <h1>Fort William</h1>
        <p>Fort William, one of the must-visit forts in Kolkata, stands as an iconic structure, reminiscent of the

        <h2>History of Fort William</h2>
        <p>The Fort was built in the year 1781 according to the order of "Sir John Goldsborough" of the British East
            India Company. Its construction was started near the south-east citadel near the banks of the Hooghly River
            according to the plans of Sir Charles Eyre. Sir Charles Eyre's successor, John Beard, added the fort to the
            north-east of this fort in the year 1701. <br>

            After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive started repairing any damage done to this fort, which he had
            completed and completed by the year 1781 and fort is being used by the Indian Army as its cantonment since
            independence.
