        <h1>Kalighat, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>As a city where history, culture, and religion converge, Kolkata has many religious sites that double as
            historical places. The Kalighat and Kali Temple are a fine case in point. The temple is more than 200 years
            old, but it finds mention in texts that date back to the 15th century. <br>

            According to historical sources, the name Calcutta was derived from Kalighat. The place also gave birth to
            one of the most distinctive styles of Indian painting called Kalighat Pata.

        <h2>History of Kalighat Temple</h2>
        <p>
            By the 1690s, when it became part of the city of Kolkata, it was already known as the sacred realm of Kali
            or Kalikshetra. The moorings (ghat in Bengali) on the bank of the Hooghly River were known to pilgrims as
            Kalighat, and there was perhaps an early version of a temple at the spot in the 17th and 18th centuries.
