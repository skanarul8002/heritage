        <h1>Raj Bhavan, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>Raj Bhavan, one of the outstanding monuments in Kolkata, serves as the official residence of the Governor of
            West Bengal. Built in neoclassical architecture with Baroque overtones, this grand three-storied structure
            was once the seat of British Imperial power. <br>

            The edifice was designed by Capt. Charles Wyatt and modeled after the residential mansion of the Curzon
            family. Interestingly, after a century of its construction in the year 1803, this building was occupied by
            George Nathaniel Curzon, the most well-known member of the Curzon family, as the Viceroy of India..<br>

        <h2>History of Raj Bhavan</h2>
        <p>In the early nineteenth century Calcutta (Kolkata) was at the height of its golden age. Known as the City of Palaces or St. Petersburg of the East, Calcutta was the richest, largest and the most elegant colonial cities of India.[2] It was during this time that one of Calcutta's finest colonial structures, Government House (later Raj Bhavan), was constructed.

            Before 1799, the Governor-General resided in a rented house, called Buckingham House, located in the same location. The land belonged to Mohammad Reza Khan, a Nawab of Chitpur.[3] It was in 1799 that the then Governor-General of India, The 1st Marquess Wellesley, took the initiative of building a palace, because he believed that India should be ruled from a palace and not from a country house. Lord Wellesley wanted to make a statement to the imperial authority and power and so the building was done on a grand scale.

            Raj Bhavan is the official residence of the governor of West Bengal, located in Kolkata, the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. Built in 1803, it was known as Government House before Indian independence.

After the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown in 1858, it became the official residence of the Viceroy of India, moving here from the Belvedere Estate. With the shifting of the British Indian capital from then Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, it became the official residence of Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Since independence in 1947 it serves as the official residence of the Governor of West Bengal and came to be known as the Raj Bhavan, a name it shares with the official residences of other states' governors.
