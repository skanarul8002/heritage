        <h1>Metcalfe Hall, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>Metcalfe Hall is a heritage place with stunning architecture that bears a close resemblance to the typical
            Greek temples in Athens. Nestled in the heart of the city’s business area, this early 19th-century building
            was initially home to the Calcutta Public Library collection.

            Today, the first floor is under the use of the Archaeological Survey of India while the ground floor is home
            to the Asiatic Society’s rare manuscripts and foreign journals.<br>

        <h2>History of Metcalfe Hall</h2>
        <p>Metcalfe Hall is a heritage building situated in Kolkata, India, at the junction of Strand Road and Hare
            Street in the heart of the city's business district. The architecture is reflective of the British imperial
            architecture at the middle of the nineteenth century, and visually similar to ancient Greek temples. It was
            built between 1840 and 1844 according to the design prepared by the city magistrate, C.K. Robinson and named
            after Sir Charles T. Metcalfe, the Governor-General of India, in honour of his efforts towards a free press.
            The building faces the Hooghly river on the West.
            <br>
            Initially, the building housed the Calcutta Public Library collection, formed by Lord Metcalf, then the
            Governor General, who transferred 4,675 volumes from the library of the College of Fort William. These
            volumes and donations of books from individuals formed the nucleus of the library, which was created under
            private auspices. Dwarkanath Tagore was the first proprietor of Calcutta Public Library.[1] Presently, the
            ground floor houses the Asiatic Society's rare foreign journals and manuscripts section,[2] while the first
            floor houses offices, exhibition galleries and a sales counter of the Archaeological Survey of India.
