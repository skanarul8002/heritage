        <p>Kolkata’s Town Hall is an exquisite historical edifice built in Roman-Doric architectural style. Constructed
            in 1813, this place was used for social gatherings of the European community living in the city at the time.
            After independence, the edifice fell into a state of neglect. But in 1998, its building was restored to its
            former glory due to the intervention of the Calcutta High Court and the Archaeological Survey of India.

            Currently, the Town Hall is used for public functions and gatherings and counts among the top historical
            buildings in Kolkata.

        <h2>History of Town Hall</h2>
        <p>
            The building of the Town Hall was made in Roman-Doric style in 1813. At first, the hall was placed under a
            committee, which allowed the public to use the hall under such terms and conditions as were fixed by the
            Government. The public could visit the ground floor hall to see statues and large size portrait paintings
            but they were not allowed indiscriminate access to the upper storey. Applications for the use of the upper
            storey were to be made to the committee. <br>

            In 1867, Town Hall came under the management of the municipal authority, the Justices of Peace for the
            improvement of the town of Kolkata (later on the Calcutta Corporation). In the 1870s, at the time of the
            Chief Justice Richard Couch, when the present building of the High Court was being built, the Town Hall was
            temporarily used for judicial purposes. In 1871, one of the Puisne Judges, Sir John Paxton Norman was
            assassinated by a fanatic Muslim of the Wahabi sect, while coming down the steps of the Town Hall. In the
            year of 1897 the Town Hall had been renovated at a cost of about Rs. 1.126 million. <br>
            In 1914, almost all the marble statues except the statue of Ramanath Tagore have been shifted to Victoria
            Memorial. After the introduction of the Dyarchy in 1919, the Town Hall was used as the council chamber of
            the Bengal Legislative Council. The interior of the Hall was remodeled to suit the needs of the Council. The
            President of the Council had his chamber in the Town Hall. Subsequently, the Legislative Council moved to
            its new building in 1931.
            During the Second World War, the government temporarily opened a Rationing Office in the Hall.
