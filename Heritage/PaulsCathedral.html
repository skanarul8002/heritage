        <h1>Paul’s Cathedral, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>St. Paul’s Cathedral is one of the most iconic churches in Kolkata, which was built in 1847 for the European
            Christians living in the city at the time. Today, this cathedral is affiliated to the Church of North India
            and is the biggest church of all. <br>

            What makes it one of the top historical places in Kolkata is its impeccable architecture which depicts
            Indo-Gothic style. It is also the first cathedral to have been constructed in the British Empire’s overseas
            territory. <br>

        <h2>History of Writers’ Building</h2>
        <p>
            The cathedral was built to replace St. John's Church, which had become too small for Calcutta's growing
            European community; by 1810 there were 4,000 British men and 300 British women in Bengal. <br>

            In 1819, at the request of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings – then Governor-General of
            Bengal – Royal Engineers officer William Nairn Forbes produced a design for the proposed cathedral; however,
            it was not accepted as it was deemed too expensive to build.[6] Bishop Middleton suggested as a site for the
            new cathedral the part of the city now known as "Fives Court", where the cathedral now stands. In 1762 the
            area had been described as a forest so wild that it harbored tigers and at first it was regarded as "too far
            south" to serve as a location for the cathedral.[8] Middleton died in 1822 before building plans took shape.
            The next three bishops – Reginald Heber, Thomas James and John Turner – all died after brief tenures, and it
            was not until 1832, under Bishop Daniel Wilson, that the project to build the cathedral was revived.[8]
