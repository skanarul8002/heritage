                <h1>Howrah Bridge, Kolkata</h1>
                <p>No list of historical places in Kolkata can be deemed complete without the majestic Howrah Bridge.
                    Commissioned in 1943, this grand structure over River Hooghly is a fine example of architectural
                    brilliance and is perhaps the most famous landmark of Kolkata.

                    Renamed as Rabindra Setu in 1965, this is the worldâ€™s busiest cantilever bridge. It shoulders daily
                    traffic of around 100,000 vehicles and more than 150,000 pedestrians.

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Location:</b>Howrah, Kolkata </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>History of Howrah Bridge</h2>
                <p>The beautiful Rabindra Setu which connects Kolkata to Howrah has today become an icon of Bengal's
                    history, culture, and tourist attractions. Popularly known as the Howrah Bridge, it was constructed
                    in 1946 and till date, sees a massive amount of traffic on a daily basis. In this article, we've
                    tried to gather all the information about the Howrah Bridge and its history for your perusal. While
                    some of these are well-known points, we promise a few fascinating tidbits that you probably didn't
                    know before reading this.

                <h3> The Plan</h3>
                <p>

                    The need for a bridge connecting the cities on either side of the Ganges was felt early on. As
                    Calcutta grew in size and became increasingly busier, the necessity was felt for increased
                    connectivity by building a bridge over the Hooghly River. <br>

                    In the year 1862, the feasibility of building a bridge was first scrutinised by the Governor of
                    Bengal who asked the then chief engineer of the East Indian Railway Company, George Turnbull, to
                    conduct a study. The initial plans proposed suggested building several other types of bridges. Some
                    even suggested a tunnel to connect the two cities. This was soon after the establishment of the
                    Howrah Station, and a bridge would significantly increase Calcutta's connectivity with the rest of
                    the country.
                    <br>
                    Turnbull, however, concluded that building a bridge at Calcutta would require considerably more
                    effort and money and was not feasible. He suggested that a suspended-girder bridge is constructed
                    about 12 miles north of Calcutta. Ultimately, nothing came of out this study, but the seeds had been
                    sown for the eventual creation of the Howrah Bridge.

                <h3> The Initial Bridge</h3>
                <p>The Calcutta Port Trust was founded in 1870 and entrusted, via the Howrah Bridge Act of 1871, with
                    the construction and maintenance of the Bridge. The first bridge connecting the two areas was a
                    Pontoon Bridge that was built in 1874 following a contract signed with Sir Bradford Leslie. Parts of
                    this bridge were built in England and then shipped to India to be assembled. <br>

                    The first bridge over the Hooghly River connecting Calcutta was opened to traffic on the 17th of
                    October 1874. It was 465.7 meters long and 19 meters wide, with 2.1 meter wide pavements on either
                    side.

                <h3> Planning and Commissioning the Howrah Bridge</h3>

                    A variety of plans were made, and several types of bridges were suggested before the Howrah Bridge
                    as we know it today was constructed. <br>

                    In 1906, a committee was set up to look into the high traffic requirements that the new bridge would
                    have to fulfil. Based on the report, the committee finally decided that a floating bridge would
                    serve the requirements best. Subsequently, tenders were extended for the design and construction,
                    and a prize amount of GBP 3,000 was announced for whoever was the winner. <br>

                    This initial plan of action was stymied by the First World War but was temporarily resumed in 1917.

                    In 1921, a team of engineers, led by Sir R. N. Mukherjee and dubbed as the 'Mukherjee Committee',
                    was set up to look into the construction of the Howrah Bridge. Interestingly, when this team
                    referred the matter to Sir Basil Mott, he suggested a single span arch bridge be built. <br>

                    In 1922, the 'Mukherjee Committee' submitted its report to the newly set up New Howrah Bridge
                    Commission. This led to the creation of the New Howrah Bridge Act. In 1926, the committee
                    recommended a suspension bridge of a particular type be constructed. Alongside the construction,
                    came the varied requirements and laws to acquire land, employ many, and levy taxes for maintenance.
                    It was the Howrah Bridge Act that ensured all these.
