        <h1>Victoria Memorial,Kolkata</h1>
        <p>An imposing white monument, Victoria Memorial is one of the most visited places in Kolkata, and for all good
            reasons. Named after Queen Victoria, it now serves as a museum and is perfect for history buffs. If you ever
            feel like taking a walk down our past and reflect on how long India has come from its colonization days,
            visit this place. There are light and sound shows held in the evening. The era of India’s freedom struggle
            is shown not only through the light and sound show but through a series of paintings, artifacts, sculptures
            and books. We would recommend spending at least 3-4 hours to gain knowledge about our country’s past.

        <h2>History of Victoria Memorial</h2>
        <p>The Victoria Memorial Hall is one of the most magnificent monuments of not only the city of Calcutta but of
            our entire country. Representing the resplendent and majestic British architecture, Victoria Memorial Hall
            stands today, as a veritable icon of the city of Kolkata. Located on 1 Queen’s way, the VMH was envisaged by
            Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of British India, as a memorial to the deceased Queen Victoria. Hence, according to
            Curzon this memorial should take form of a great marble hall, which was to be erected on the Calcutta maidan
            to serve primarily as a monument to the Queen and secondarily as a national gallery and Valhalla of the
            Indian Empire. <br>

            The national gallery which Curzon speaks about would in future take the shape of a museum. The Victoria
            Memorial hall was therefore set up to function more than just a memorial for the deceased Queen Victoria.
            The memorial was to be designed with a museum housed within its realms. The memorial with the museum would
            act as a “standing record of our wonderful history” This was to be a historical museum where people could
            see before them pictures and statues of men who played a prominent part in the history of this country and
            develop a pride in their past. Curzon’s writing bring forth that it was a part of his imperial duty to put
            into execution to set up a “Great Imperial memorial worthy of Queen Victoria and worthy of India.
            <br>
            Within few weeks after Queen’ death in January 1901 a great meeting was convened in the Town Hall of
            Calcutta on 6th February, 1901, whereby a resolution for constituting an all Indian Memorial Fund for
            building of the memorial was moved. The princes and people of India responded Architects generously to his
            appeal for funds and the total cost of construction of this monument amounting to one crore, five lakhs of
            rupees, was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions. King George V, the then Prince of Wales,
            laid the foundation stone on January 4, 1906 and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.
