        <h1> Shaheed Minar, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>Topping the list of must-visit historical sites in Kolkata is Shaheed Minar. This memorial was erected in
            1828 in the memory of Sir David Ochterlony, who was a commander in the British East India Company, to
            commemorate his victories on the battlefield. It was thus originally known as Ochterlony Monument. <br>

            However, in August 1969, this monument was re-dedicated to the memory of the martyrs of India’s struggle for
            independence and was renamed Shaheed Minar (martyrs’ monument).

        <h2>History of Town Hall</h2>
        <p>
            Located at the very heart of Kolkata, the 158-foot high, pristine white Shaheed Minar has remained a
            landmark monument for over a century and a half. Its characteristic design and size has drawn the attention
            of many, including Mark Twain who dubbed it the ‘cloud kissing monument.’ However, the structure’s history
            remains just as interesting as its architecture. <br>
            Constructed in 1828 as a tribute to Major-General Sir David Ochterlony, commander of the British East India
            Company, the tower was initially known as the Ochterlony Monument. The structure sought to celebrate his
            defense of British occupied territory in the Indian subcontinent against the Marathas and other regional
            armies. However, in 1969, decades after India gained independence, the monument was rededicated to the
            memory of the martyrs of the Indian freedom movement. It was then renamed the Shaheed Minar, which
            translates to ‘the Martyr’s Monument.’ <br>
            The tall structure displays a blend of various architectural styles, including a Turkish-style rounded dome,
            an Egyptian foundation and a column inspired by those seen in Syria. A serpentine staircase with about 223
            steps leads to the top floor of the monument. Designed by architect J.P. Parker, the building offers a
            panoramic view of the city.
