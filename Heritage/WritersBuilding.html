        <h2>History of Writers’ Building</h2>
        <p>Originally, the Writers’ Building was built to serve as the office of the writers of the British East India
            Company. However, now it serves as the Secretariat Building of the State Government of West Bengal in India.
            Presently, it is also has the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal. The building was designed by
            Thomas Lyon in 1777. However, Writers’ Building has undergone a number of extensions over the years. <br>

            In the year 1821, a 128 ft-long verandah admired with Ionic style columns, each of 32-ft height was added on
            the first and second floor of the building. Between 1889 and 1906, two new blocks were built. Iron
            staircases lead to this newly added blocks. The Greco-Roman look of the building featuring red surface of
            exposed bricks makes it appear interesting. The parapet was put in the perfect place. Statues crafted by
            William Fredric Woodington were installed on the terrace. <br>

            The giant pediment built at the heart of the building houses the statue of Minerva. The terrace also houses
            a number of other statues, the most notable being four clusters of statues, ‘Commerce’, ‘Justice’,
            ‘Agriculture’ and ‘Science’ with the Greek Gods and Goddesses. A more recent sculpture of the
            revolutionaries Benoy, Badal and Dinesh stands carved in black near its entrance. <br>

            Writers’ Building stretching for around 150-meters spans the whole of the northern extension of the water
            body, famously called Lal Dighi in B.B.D. Bagh area. Several departments belonging to the State Government
            of West Bengal are located in this building.</p>
