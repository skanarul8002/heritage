        <h1>Marble Palace</h1>
        <p>This palatial mansion in North Kolkata was built by Raja Rajendra Mullick, an affluent Bengali merchant. This
            well-preserved 19th-century residence derives its name from its marble walls, floors, and sculptures. One of
            the best-known heritage monuments in Kolkata, this mansion is designed in neoclassical architectural style.
            <br>
            This three-storied structure stands tall with lawns, gardens, a lake, a rock garden, and a zoo in its
            surroundings. Marble Palace also boasts of a rich collection of paintings and priceless artworks. A visit to
            this palace is certainly one of the top things to do in Kolkata, especially for history buffs and art
            lovers.

        <h2>History of Marble Palace</h2>
        <p>
            The house was built in 1835 by Raja Rajendra Mullick, a wealthy Bengali merchant with a passion for
            collecting works of art. The house continues to be a residence for his descendants, and the current
            occupants are the family of Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur. Raja Rajendra Mullick was the adopted son of
            Nilmoni Mullick, who built a Jagannath temple which predates Marble Palace, and still stands within the
            premises, but is only accessible to members of the family.
