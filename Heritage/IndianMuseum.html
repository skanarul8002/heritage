        <h2>History of Metcalfe Hall</h2>
        <p>
            The Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal which was created by Sir William Jones in
            1784. The concept of having a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a place where
            man-made and natural objects collected could be kept, cared for and displayed. <br>

            The objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the Society was offered suitable accommodation by the
            Government of India in the Chowringhee-Park Street area. <br>
            On February 2, 1814, Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist, who had been captured in the siege of Serampore
            but later released, wrote to the council of the Asiatic Society for the formation of a museum out of his own
            collection and that of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, volunteering his service as a Curator wherein he
            proposed five sections—an archaeological, ethnological, a technical section and a geological and zoological
            one.[14] The council readily agreed and the Museum was created, with Wallich named the Honorary Curator and
            then Superintendent of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society. Wallich also donated a number of
            botanical specimens to the museum from his personal collection. In 1815, Mr William Lloyd Gibbons, Asst
            Secretary and Librarian, was appointed Joint Secretary of the Museum. <br>

            After the resignation of Wallich, curators were paid salaries by the Asiatic Society ranging from Rs 50 to
            Rs 200 a month. However, in 1836, when the bankers of the Asiatic Society (Palmer and Company) became
            insolvent, the Government began to pay the salary of the Curator from its public funds since a large part of
            the collection was that of the surveyors of Survey of India.
